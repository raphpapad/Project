ModuleString: Create the module “MyString”, which will contain implementations of the most commonly used string functions. Specifically, the MyString module will contain the following functions, which will behave like the corresponding functions in C:
ms_length -> strlen
ms_copy -> strcpy
ms_ncopy -> strncpy
ms_concat -> strcat
ms_nconcat -> strncat
ms_compare -> strcmp
ms_ncompare -> strncmp
ms_search -> strstr.<br>
Symbol Table: Each instance of the SymTable ADT will be a symbol table. You must design the SymTable ADT to be “generic,” meaning that the values ​​are void pointers, and therefore can point to data of any type. You will create two implementations of the SymTable ADT: one implementation that uses a linked list and one that uses a hash table. The SymTable ADT you create will be useful later..<br>
