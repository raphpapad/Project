	Attacks an opponent.

		3. At the end of the attack it must be printed that the current warrior (his name) 
		attacked the adversary (his name) as well as the new state (health) of the adversary. 
		After the attack, the adversary's state must be less than its previous state.
	Algorithm (for calculating the force that will be removed from the adversary)
		1. We take the power of the attacker.
		2. If the attacker has a weapon, we take the weapon's power.
		3. The sum of steps 1, 2 is the total reduction that will be made to the defender's condition.
